[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/istana/libnss-maria.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/istana/libnss-maria)

Replacement for old libnss-mysql as naming service library in Linux.

You can store user information in MariaDB/MySQL database. E.g. `ls` then automatically shows user name from the database, `getent` shows users and groups.

## Features

- cmake build system
- libconfig for configuration
- uses direct queries and real_escape_string
- uses threads.c from C11
- requirements: Glibc 2.28, GCC8, equivalent of Debian 10 (Buster) and newer, MySQL5.5+/MariaDB10.0+, mariadb-connector-c/mysql-client.
    Might work or compile on older systems, but it's untested
- tested systems - Archlinux, Centos, Debian (buster/stable), Fedora, latest Ubuntu, Ubuntu LTS
- both unix socket and host are supported

## TODO

- TLS config options
- v1 version
- announce
- deb + rpm packages + universal package managers too
- fix bug with too many users in a group - not a bug, just buffer is too small (1k) for all group members and glibc won't retry with a larger one
- code quality analyzer in addition to strict compiler checks
- more unit tests

## Build && Test in Vagrant

```bash
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install virtualbox
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

vagrant up
./scripts/build-vagrant.sh
# or ./scripts/build-vagrant-release.sh
```

The result is in `./Debug/src` or `./Release/src`directory.

## Build && Test in Docker

`docker-compose up`
`./scripts/build-docker.sh`

The result is in `./Debug/src` directory.

## Build && Test on a Linux system

Required libraries for building the library and test:

```
apt-get install coreutils build-essential cmake libmariadb-dev libconfig-dev syslog-ng-dev bats
apt-get install syslog-ng mariadb-client libconfig9 mariadb-server ruby pkg-config

./script/build-debug.sh
```

Set `RELEASE` variable to any value to build a release build.

## Installation & Usage

See `examples/sos-sso` and `script/compile_and_test.sh` to see how to set it up and use.

## Debug

https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion/issues/206

Save this as criterion.gdb and start gdb with gdb ./yourtest -x criterion.gdb.

Then, from the gdb prompt, just call run, list children with info inferiors, switch inferiors with inferior <n>, and debug just as usual.
